# Python++
Python 3, but with proper encapsulation.

[View on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pythonpp/)

PythonPP stands for ***Python** **P**lus **P**lus*.

Python++ allows Python programmers to use object oriented programming principles in Python.
Similar to Java, variables and methods can be **encapsulated**, or made **private**. 

Encapsulation is useful when storing sensitive persistent data within instances of objects.
For example, a programmer may want to hold a user's password in a variable - however,
in vanilla Python, the password variable can be manipulated by any external code in possession of the object instance. 
Python++ prevents such behavior by introducing private variables and methods to Python.

## Installation
The package is available on PyPI.
You can install the package with the following command:
```shell
pip install pythonpp
```

## Usage

**A PythonPP object must extend PythonPP's `ObjPP` class.**
**The constructor must also call the `__init__` method of the parent `ObjPP` class.**

> When no ``__init__`` method is defined, `super().__init__()` will be executed automatically.


Example:
```python
from pythonpp import *

# Class extends pythonpp's ObjPP class.
class Test(ObjPP):
    # Class constructor
    def __init__(self):
        # Call ObjPP's constructor.
        super().__init__()
    def namespace(public, private):
        # public: the public scope.
        # private: the private scope.
        pass
```

Alternatively, you can create your class without using a wildcard import.

```python
import pythonpp as ppp

class Test(ppp.ObjPP):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
    def namespace(public, private):
        pass
```

> **All variable and method declarations must be done in the `namespace` method.**

 The namespace method has two parameters.

| Parameter | Value |
|:----------|:------|
| `public`  | The public scope. All variables in this scope can be accessed externally.
| `private` | The private scope. All variables in this scope can only be accessed internally. |

You can define public and private variables using these scopes.

> **All variables and methods are declared private by default when the scope is not specified.**
**When you create a variable or method, it is highly recommended that you declare it private unless <u>absolutely necessary</u>.**

Example:
```python
# public variable
public.hello = "hello"

# private variable
private.world = "world"
```

You can also use the public and private scopes to declare methods.

Example:
```python
# public method
@method(public)
def publicMethod():
    print("Called publicMethod")

# private method
@method(private)
def privateMethod():
    print("Called privateMethod")
```

Public variables and methods can be accessed as usual.

Example:
```python
test = Test()
# works as normal
print(test.hello)
# also works as normal
test.publicMethod()
```

However, private variables and methods **cannot be accessed** externally.

Example:
```python
test = Test()
# results in an error
print(test.world)
# also results in an error
test.privateMethod()
```

## Inheritance

All Python++ classes must extend the `ObjPP` class. You can also create Python++ classes that extend other classes using multiple inheritance.

> For Python++ to work properly, you must call `ObjPP`'s constructor at some point in the `__init__` method.

Example:
```python
# parent class
class Parent():
    # Parent constructor
    def __init__(self):
        print("Parent constructor")

# child class
class Child(ObjPP, Parent):
    # Child constructor
    def __init__(self):
        print("Child constructor")
        super(ObjPP, self).__init__()
        super(Parent, self).__init__()

    def namespace(public, private):
        pass
```

Alternatively, you can call the superclass constructors like so:

```python
# child class
class Child(ObjPP, Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        # Same as super(ObjPP, self).__init__()
        ObjPP.__init__(self)
        # Same as super(Parent, self).__init__()
        Parent.__init__(self)

    def namespace(public, private):
        pass
```

```python
from pythonpp import *

class Test(ObjPP):
    # Class constructor
    def __init__(self):
        # Call ObjPP's constructor.
        super().__init__()

    # Place all methods and field declerations here.
    def namespace(public, private):
        # public variable
        public.hello = "hello"
        # private variable
        private.world = "world"

        # public method
        @method(public)
        def publicMethod():
            print("Called publicMethod")
        
        # private method
        @method(private)
        def privateMethod():
            print("Called privateMethod")

        # public method to call the private method.
        @method(public)
        def callPrivateMethod():
            print("Calling privateMethod()")
            # Call the private method
            private.privateMethod()
```
